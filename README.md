 # Project overview and instructions
 # 🎵 Music Generation with AI (LSTM)

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Internship — **TASK 3: Music Generation with AI**.

It uses deep learning (LSTM) to learn from MIDI music files and generate new music automatically.

---

## ✅ Project Overview

This AI system learns musical patterns from `.mid` files (MIDI format) using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. After training, it can generate its own unique music which is saved as MIDI files and played on any MIDI-supported player.

## 🧠 Steps Performed in the Project

### 1. Collect MIDI Data
- Used datasets like [Lakh MIDI Dataset (LMD)](https://www.kunstderfuge.com/albeniz.htm)
- Downloaded MIDI files (`.mid`) for training

### 2. Preprocess the Data
- Used `music21` to extract notes and chords from MIDI files
- Converted note sequences into numerical format suitable for training

### 3. Build LSTM Model
- Created an LSTM-based deep learning model using Keras & TensorFlow
- Designed it to predict the next note based on previous notes

### 4. Train the Model
- Trained on preprocessed note sequences
- Model saved to `models/model.h5` for future use (no need to retrain every time)

### 5. Generate Music
- Used trained model to generate new note sequences
- Saved the output to a file called `output/generated.mid`

### 6. Play the Music
- Used `music21` and system MIDI player to listen to generated music
- Optional: Imported `.mid` into an online tool like [Online Sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/)
